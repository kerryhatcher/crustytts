//! Shared neural-network building blocks used by model backends.
//!
//! Qwen-family backends use grouped-query attention and SiLU-gated MLPs,
//! while Kokoro uses ALBERT + LSTM + ISTFTNet. This module provides reusable
//! implementations so the model-specific code only has to deal with
//! architecture differences.
